              Wait right here<br/>
             I'll be back in the morning<br/>
I know that I'm not that important to you<br/>
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous<br/>
So much more than perfect<br/>
Right now, I know that I'm not really worth it<br/>
If you give me time, I can work on it<br/>
Give me some time while I work on it<br/>
<br/>
Losing your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you<br/>
The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me<br/>
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist<br/>
'Cause we only have one conversation a week<br/>
That's why your friends always hating on me<br/>
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself<br/>
Matter of fact, I ain't never ask no one for help<br/>
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it ring<br/>
<br/>
None of my exes is over Lil Peep<br/>
Nobody flexing as much as I be<br/>
That's why she text me and tell me she loves me<br/>
She knows that someday I'll be over the sea<br/>
Making my money and smoking my weed<br/>
I think it's funny, she open up to me<br/>
Get comfortable with me, once I got it coming<bt/>
I love her, she loves me<br/>
<br/>
I know that I'm nothing<br/>
Like someone her family want me to be<br/>
If I find a way, would you walk with me?<br/>
Look at my face while you talking to me<br/>
'Cause we only have one conversation a week<br/>
Can I get one conversation at least?<br/>
Shout out to everyone making my beats<br/>
You helping me preach<br/>
This music is the only thing keeping the peace<br/>
When I'm falling to pieces<br/>
<br/>
Look at the sky tonight<br/>
All of the stars have a reason<br/>
A reason to shine, a reason like mine,<br/>
And I'm falling to pieces<br/>
Look at the sky tonight<br/>
All of the stars have a reason<br/>

  Sempre gostei de todas as músicas dele, mas infelizmente ele faleceu, então isso foi muito triste, mas algumas músicas dele foi bom em certo momento para mim, quando estive numa situação muito ruim da minha vida e muita coisa que eu vi e ouvi nas músicas fez-me repensar e olhar o melhor caminho.
